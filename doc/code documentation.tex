\section{Explanation of the game}

You are controlling Thorn, a young adventurer and you have a new quest in this adventure. You's trying to gather all the four Statues of Youth. Those would let you make any wish he wants. Unfortunately, those statues are being kept by the terrible Girk. He's been keeping them for years as his glorious treasure. Now has come the time for you to pick them up and make any wish come true.

On your way to the statues, you will face many dangers. You'll start in a outside where there's only one door facing you. You will therefore have to make choices about where you choose to go. 

If you meet an enemy, you will have a choice : whether trying to flee but with a low chance of success, or you can directly attack and bravely face the danger. But be careful, you don't know how the strong the enemy is yet. 

If you get lucky on your way, you might find a magic key that can unlock any door. But be aware that you can only use one per door. You can also find weapons or potions on your way so watch your steps.
