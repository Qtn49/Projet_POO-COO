\maketitle

Our main player, Thorn has a new quest in his adventure. He's trying to gather all the four Statues of Youth. Those would lead him to get his parents back to life. Unfortunately, those statues are kept by the terrible Girk. He's been them for years as his treasure. Now has come the time for you (Thorn) to pick them up and bring your parents back to life.

\section{First scenario}

On his way to the statues, he will face many dangers. He'll start in a room where there's only one room facing him. He decides whether he knocks at the door or uses the doorbell. In case he knocked the door, he will be lead to an elevator which is actually a shortcut to go directly to one of the statues' room. But if he rings the doorbell, a fairy will appear and propose him a deal : get a helmet which makes him earn 10 more health points, some anti-slip boots or a ring of fortune. He then can take the longest path. On his way, there will be chest containing keys, locked doors to open with keys and ennemies.
